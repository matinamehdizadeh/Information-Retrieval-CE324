# Information-retrieval

In this project an information retrieval system was implemented using python.

At first the given dataset was preprocess, tokennized and indexed. Then, the ducuments were compressed using gamma-code and variable-byte. At the end the ducuments were retrieved using tf-idf and the words that were important to the scoring was highlited. Also, spell correction was implemented using bigram indexing and jacard distance.
